a) README.md - unmodified
b) README.md - modified
   fun_problem.txt - untracked
c) README.md - modified
   fun_problem.txt - unmodified
d) README.md - modified
   fun_problem.txt - modified
e) README.md - modified
   fun_problem.txt - unmodified
   fun_problem.txt is empty because checkout makes the file revert to its last commit
f) README.md is both staged for commit and not staged for commit. This is because I
   added the changes with git add, but then modified the file again afterwards. Git
   will only commit up to where I did my git add and will not stage whatever changes
   I made afterwards ("echo 'Fancy git move' >> README.md").

bool empty() const: theta(1)
	- just returns int variable size_

void push(const double& val): theta(1)
	- constant time since I'm always inserting at head
	- since it is a linked list, I don't have to move other items, only head
	  and its next value;

double const& top() const: theta(1)
	- because I chose to use head instead of tail, the helper function
	  getNodeAt(int loc) will always iterated only once to return the item
	  at location 0.

void pop(): theta(1)
	- because the stack is implemented with a linked list, removing the head happens 
	  in constant time.
